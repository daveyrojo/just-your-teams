Project 2

Sports League news site

Pitch: 
The modern sports website is too convoluted and numerous. We are aiming to build a clean, preferences focus news resource for sports. The user will be prompted to pick a preference of leagues/teams upon initial log in and will only see news related to results, current matches, upcoming fixtures and press releases. This will make our website a personalized team feed as opposed to requiring a user to syphon through pages upon pages to find the news they are looking for. 

create a site that allows a user to login and track their favorite team from EPL to start -> then add La Liga -> then add NBA
user will be able to see live match updates, previous scores, upcoming matches and press releases if available
    If work moves quickly we will expand to multiple leagues/Sports
